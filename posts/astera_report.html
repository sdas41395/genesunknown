        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>To whomever it concerns,</p>
        <p>
            Throughout my career, I’ve worked at the intersection of engineering, biotechnology, and healthcare. I used these opportunities to hone my skills in conceptualizing software products based on scientists’ requirements, designing and building software applications, and delivering a tangible impact to scientists and physicians in academia and industry alike.
        </p>
        <p>
            In my role as the sole engineer at Denali Therapeutics, I built software solutions alongside different -omics groups from initial whiteboarding to full production to aid in Alzheimer’s therapeutics. At Octant, I led multiple software projects from automated experiment design to machine learning analysis pipelines. These multifaceted roles were a combination of my skills in both software development and scientific collaboration in order to provide seamless solutions that would directly impact bottom lines of our internal teams such as screening and high-throughput chemistry.

        <h2>Scientific Computing and Biotechnology</h2>
        <p>
            The world is experiencing a revolution in computing. Hardware improvements in chip design and manufacturing have resulted in exponential growth in our ability to ingest, transform, predict, and increasingly consume data. The sheer quantity and scale of scientific data is no longer a bottleneck, but a feature that we can use to power new algorithms to give us insight into biological pathways and systems.
        </p>
        <p>
            These generated insights will be the rationale behind future life-saving drugs and medicines. However, to fully utilize these breakthroughs, we must have both high-quality data that is standardized and contextualized, as well as a quantity of data large enough for these systems to learn.

        <h2>Challenges in Compound Procurement</h2>
        <p>
            The barriers to compound procurement and management can be divided into three main challenges:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Vendor Selection:</strong> The current process is restricted in providing a comprehensive landscape of what is available.</li>
            <li><strong>Manual Scanning:</strong> Compounds are nearly impossible to manually scan, consuming chemists' time and resources.</li>
            <li><strong>Order Tracking:</strong> Tracking of compound orders and logistics is costly and suffers from outdated UI and software.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            A better system needs to be in place to factor in logistical and industrial realities as chemists must navigate the intricacies of sourcing vendors, negotiating prices, and figuring out packaging and shipping times. Many of these processes are still manually managed through email, Excel, or overpriced or outdated software.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
        <h2>Proposed Solution</h2>
        <p>
            In order to address these barriers, my initial solution focuses on building a software platform that horizontally captures users through the procurement and management pipeline. 
        </p>
        <p>The key features include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Vendor catalog aggregation and suggestion.</li>
            <li>Seamless lookup of vendor catalogs by chemical makeup.</li>
            <li>Generated chemical properties that chemists can use to further narrow their search criteria.</li>
            <li>Structurally and chemically similar compound suggestions based on similarity or substructure search of collected catalogs.</li>
            <li>Order submission and tracking via a dashboard.</li>
            <li>Bulk orders for cost reduction.</li>
            <li>Structured data integration for contract research organizations and molecule database managers.</li>
            <li>Machine learning models to suggest compounds for primary screens and aid in future research programs.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
        <h2>Development Roadmap</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Q1:</strong> Collect user stories and develop an MVP that provides search and management functions across embedded vendor catalogs.</li>
            <li><strong>Q2:</strong> Pilot with academic institutions to iterate on procurement features and onboard inventory management and order tracking.</li>
            <li><strong>Q3:</strong> Open-source and publish the platform online for public use.</li>
            <li><strong>Q4:</strong> Pilot for biotech procurement and management teams, partner with vendors for on-demand generation or shipping, and ideate for future updates.</li>
        </ol>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
        <h2>Projected Costs</h2>
        <h3>Compute Costs</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Hosting (frontend & backend): $50 - $100 / month</li>
            <li>Provisioned database for embeddings: $200 - $400 / month</li>
            <li>Postgres database for metadata: $100 - $200 / month</li>
            <li>LLM inference server: $200 - $400 / month</li>
            <li>External compute resources for testing: $100 / month</li>
            <li><strong>Total cost per year:</strong> $14,400</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Personnel Costs</h3>

            <li>Quarterly onsite travel: $6,000</li>
            <li>Conference travel & accommodations: $6,000</li>
            <li><strong>Total cost per year:</strong> $212,000</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
            To achieve these goals, I would greatly benefit from working with those who have a strong background in chemistry or direct experience in high-throughput chemistry within industry. Additionally, I am eager to learn from others who have experience in scaling a business and interacting with investors and financial models.
        </p>
        <p>
            I’m looking forward to working with future collaborators of diverse backgrounds.
